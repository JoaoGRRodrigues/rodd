Other operational applications, based on the use of measurements of the backscattering coefficient, are sea ice edge detection and monitoring, monitoring sea ice, snow cover, soil moisture and surface parameters. The product is available from the archive in 2 different spatial resolutions; 25 km and 12.5 km. Note that some of the data are reprocessed.
